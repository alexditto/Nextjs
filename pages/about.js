            <p> Thank you for visiting my simple website. This website is an example of my experience with 
                Nextjs and React. 
            </p>
            <p> I have been coding and working in software development for a little under a year. Much of my
                 focus has been on JavaScript and front-end development, though I am working towards becoming
                 a full-stack developer and develop more websites like this one. 
            </p>
            <p> If you are interested in looking into my examples of code or the lines that this website needed
                to be ready to function, feel free to look at the code <a href="https://github.com/alexditto" target="_blank">here.</a>
            </p>
            <p> Above all, thanks for stoping by and checking out my site.
